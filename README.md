# ai-ml-model-testing
This repository contains the framework and implementations for testing AI/ML models, specifically focusing on conversational AI solutions. The project encompasses various aspects of AI service testing, including multi-channel interactions, risk assessment, and content safety evaluations.


Key Components

**Multi-Channel AI Service Testing Project
**
--- Testing Framework Development:

Designed and implemented end-to-end testing frameworks to validate a Conversational AI solution aimed at automating customer interactions for a leading utility provider.
Utilized Botium to develop and execute automated test scripts simulating diverse user interactions, validating conversational flows for both scripted and LLM-powered (GPT-4o-based) chatbot systems across multiple scenarios and platforms.

NLP-Driven Evaluation: Applied advanced NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, named entity recognition, intent classification, and sentiment analysis to evaluate the AIâ€™s contextual understanding.

AI Model Performance Verification: Assessed response quality through semantic similarity techniques (cosine similarity) and Natural Language Understanding models.

Dynamic Prompt Generation: Currently integrating GPT-4o Mini to simulate realistic user inputs, enhancing interaction quality and ensuring the completeness and appropriateness of responses.
